            <p>
                The system provides a search component for differents places in the site. This search component is a 
                powerful Google-like searcher that it would normally find what the user is looking for. Please observe
                the following rules for its use:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>All you need to do is to type the search criteria in the text box of the search.
                    <img src="SearchComponent_simple.gif" alt="general example" class="img-responsive" />
                </li>
                <li>To apply a more refined search feel free to use the advanced search form (if available)
                    <img src="SearchComponent_advanced.gif" alt="advanced search example" class="img-responsive" />
                </li>
                <li>Or type the criteria for each of the columns
                    <img src="SearchComponent_specific.gif" alt="specific search example" class="img-responsive" />
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Depending on the type of column, the specific search has different rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Numeric Search</b>: you can use the greater than, lower than and between operators. The 
                equal operator is implied when no operator is used. Here are some examples:<br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <pre>@id 100</pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <pre>@height &gt; 25</pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <pre>@age &lt; 10</pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <pre>@number 30:40</pre>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                </li>
                <li><b>Date Search</b>: it should be used just like the Numeric Search except that dates should be
                    represented in the international standard date notation which is:
                    <p align="center">YYYY-MM-DD</p>
                    where YYYY is the year in the usual Gregorian calendar, MM is the month of the year between 01 
                    (January) and 12 (December), and DD is the day of the month between 01 and 31.<br />
                    For example, the fourth day of February in the year 1995 is written in the standard notation as
                    <p align="center">1995-02-04</p>
                    Additionally, you can use functions ($year, $month and $day) to 
                    be applied to the date column. For example, to search for the people for which
                    their birthday is on May, 5th:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <pre>$day(@birth) 5 and $month(@birth) 5</pre>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Of course, you can always use the comparisons with these functions.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </li>
                <li><b>String Search</b>: There are two types of strings, the indexed strings and not indexed strings.
                    The first ones mean that the system knows even how to understand these strings; for example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <pre>Mark Twain</pre>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Should find all ocurrences of 'Mark Twain' as well as 'Twain, Mark'. 
                    <br />
                    NOT indexed strings can only use a wildcard '*' at the beginning or at the end of a string:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <pre>@name Mar*</pre>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                </li>
                <li><b>Boolean Search</b>: These are the most simple type of columns. The only values allowed here 
                    are: true (or 1) and false (or 0)
                </li>
            </ul>
