# KPITool
A generic Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Tracking tool

This is a tool that is used to track KPIs for an organization. It was designed to be simple to use, yet poweerful enough to be used in any organization. The tool was originally designed and built by Artexacta S.R.L. (see http://www.artexacta.com) and was donated as an OpenSource project on April of 2016.

The tools is a Web-based ASP.NET 4.0 system that uses SLQ Server Express (or higher) as a database engine (we recommend that yu use SQL Server Express 2014 with Advanced Services but SQL Server Express 2008 or above should work).
